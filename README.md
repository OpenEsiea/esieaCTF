# EsieaCTF write-ups
There are some problems with CTF write-ups in general:

* they’re scattered across the interwebs
* they don’t usually include the original files needed to solve the challenge
* some of them are incomplete or skip ‘obvious’ parts of the explanation, and are therefore not as helpful for newcomers
* often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog
* This repository aims to solve those problems.
